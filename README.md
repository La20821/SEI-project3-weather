## Initial Purpose
The purpose of this project is to develop a handy and easy-to-use app that allows the user to retrieve data regarding the current temperatures, as well as a 7 day forecast for a specific location area. Additionally, the app should be able to store user favorite locations where the user can easily select the saved locations from the home page to access weather.

## Collaboration - The Team

Thus far, as young developers we have been consistently reminded of the value of teamwork and successful collaboration. During this project, we had the opportunity to experience working among a team on a web application development project. It was neccessary toward the beginning to map out roles and responisibilities as best as possible to ensure equal commitment as well expound on each other's strengths while ensuring we build on any opportunity areas. We spent the beginning piece of the project ensuring that we all understood neccessary git commands that would allow us all to contribute to the master file remotely. We then mapped out tasks and assigned them accordingly to one another. We remained patient and engaged, while doing our best to communicate as clearly and consistently.
